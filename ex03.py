# Study drills
# 1 above each line, user the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does
# 2 remember in exercise 0 when you started python3.6? start python3.6 this way again and using the math operators, use python as a calculator
# 3 find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it
# 4 rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point
